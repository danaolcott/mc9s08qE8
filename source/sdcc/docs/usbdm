installing usbdm is a bit of a pain.  All the packages that you have to 
install seem to be out of date, not available, etc.

Here's a gist of some of the packages you need to install:

usbdm package - .deb file.  Trying to install this directory will 
result in an error about missing package: libxerces-c3.1.
On my system, I could install -c3.2 but not 3.1.  After some searching, 
I found the following:
 
libxerces-c3.1_3.1.4+debian-2_amd64.deb

Trying to install this resulted in a different error:
Missing package libicu_57.  I could find _60, but after installing
that it still would not work.   After some more searching, I found
 the following package:

libicu57_57.1-5ubuntu0.2_amd64.deb


With those downloaded and ready, installed the following order:

sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/libicu57_51.1-5ubuntu0.2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/libxerces-c3.1_3.1.4+debian-2_amd64.deb

Finally....
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/usbdm_4.12.1.210-1-x86_64.deb

They really dont make it easy....


The above steps should be able to install usbdm.  Thinking
about it some more, one could have just installed usbdm by doing the
sudo apt-change search.... etc.

After installing usbdm....
Run the following: /user/bin/UsbdmScript

List the commands: ?

% settarget HCS08
USBDM DLL Version = 4.12.1.210
BDM List:
 0 - USBDM-JS16-0001      : USBDM HCS08,HCS12,Coldfire-V1 BDM

:setTarget HCS08
% connect
USBDM device is not open
% openbdm
Opening USBDM-JS16-0001

% 

//with the target now open....
//set the target device
//note: if you try to do this before connecting it usually crashes
setdevice -list
setdevice MC9S08QE8

connect
